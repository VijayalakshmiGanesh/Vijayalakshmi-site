    </div><br>
    <hr>
    <h3> Who are Pandyas??? </h3>
    <p>Pandyas was one of the ancient and powerful empires who majorly ruled South India and north of Sri Lanka. The
        name 'Pandya' came from "Pandaya" which means they are ancient people. When we hear the name Pandyas, the first
        thing that comes to mind is MADURAI MEENATCHI AMMAN TEMPLE. Here the word 'Meenatchi' can be splitted into
        "MEEN" which means Fish and "ATCHI" means Rule which depicts the logo/symbol of Pandyas (two fishes). And this
        Warrior
        princess 'Meenatchi' was ruling madurai and was married to Sundareshwarar , also refered as Lord Shiva and both
        of them were ruling the place. Here we can`t tell if its mythology or history. Thats how ancient pandyas are
        people.Even pandyas have been mentioned in Mahabharatha that they have fought alongside of Pandavas which
        proves the existence of empire. The above mentioned points can be a myth too. We are not sure.

        Coming to history, When Marco Polo visited
        India, He has mentioned that so far, Pandyan dynasty is the Richest place . The reason is business. Their main
        port is
        tutucorin
        sea port and these people earned many resources by selling "Pearls", etc and also told that Pandyas are the
        people who took/harvested most of pearls and sold them. Also he has said they were so
        hygienic that each and
        every one of them had their own cups and plates. Also, they dont sip the tumblers while drinking. And, almost
        all
        of them were against consuming alcohols and the society weren't respecting people who were consuming it.
    </p>
    <p>Pandyas
        liked the color 'Black'. From God Idols to important and familiar people, everyone were black. If a child was
        born with dark skin tone, their parents celebrated happily . This shows how much they liked and respected the
        color black.
        Pandyas associated the color 'White' with bad things and 'Black' with good fortunes which was quite different
        among other places. Last but not least, Pandyas had a tie up with Cheras, Pallavas and Sinhalese, and captured
        main places like Madurai, Uraiyur and Tanjore from Cholas almost completely.

    </p>
    <p>Their business went so well with
        UAE which was noticed by a commander of Khilji's empire. As these Pandyas people were so wealthy and strong,
        Khilji's empire planned to capture pandyas. At the time, Pandyas were not strong since the princes were fighting
        among themselves for throne which gave the benefit to Khiljis and they captured Pandyas. Literally, they took
        all the
        resources from Pandyas. Almost a lakhs of Horses ( As Horse is not a native animal of India, they would have
        bought with money earned by doing business with Arabs for wars) and Thousands of Elephants. And that`s the wrap
        to Pandyan Dynasty..
