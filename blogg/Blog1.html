    <h3> Interesting Facts about Cholas other than regular school history book stories</h3>
    <p>The logo of cholas is a tiger but their strength lies in Water, because Cholas conquested more in water than land
        just like No one can defeat a crocodile in water. Cholas was the First Empire to have a Standing Army
        (professionally trained soldiers). Cholas had a strong and proper army 'RATHA GAJA THURADHI PADAI' which means
        Chariot, Elephants, Horse, and
        Cavalry.The places which were
        ruled by Cholas known as 'Chola Mandalam' later it was renamed as 'Coramandel Coast' by portuguese. Also, Roman
        coins were found in this places which indicates that they have done business with Rome.

        In China Records, it is registered that almost a thousand years ago, Cholas built an embassy in China for trade
        purpose which was a Profitable venture.

        Their main port was located in Poompugar which is a town in
        mayiladuthurai district in Tamil nadu. In history, poompugar was a famous place just like how well known and
        significant place Chennai is
        now. This place 'Poompugar' is also described as an Architecturally marvellous city which had many international
        connections
        for import and export products which was built and developed by these Cholas people.
        They had a Tax system like Professional tax, Land Tax, Customs Tax which netizens
        felt difficult to pay it which at present is being followed with proper names to the taxes.<br />

        A Man- made lake, Currently named as 'Veeranam lake' was built by Cholas for their netizens which covered an
        area of length 11.2 kilometers and width 4 kilometers to avoid Water scarcity issue. Presently, it is one of the
        reservoirs which supplies water to Chennai city.

    <p> Coming to a Negative point, It is told that during the period of Cholas, the most caste related violence occured
        is with
        Shaivas (Lord
        Shiva followers) and
        Vaishanavas (Lord Vishnu followers). The reason behind this clashes is Cholas are mostly Shaivas . 108 temples
        were
        built across kaveri river area by a single chola king. thats how much cholas were devoting Lord shiva. So, while
        promoting the Shaivas religion, Vaishnavas devotees and Shaivas devotees had so much of fghts between them
        . There are also many theories which says King Raja raja chola did Sanskritization of
        Tamil (merged tamil and sanskrit). Thats why even now, we are able to see sanskrit words in temple walls and
        even
        Pandits are telling Sanskrit Mantras.

        Chola captured Pandyas and ruled over many places successfully for almost 5 centuries and Pandyas came
        back with more power and took back their place from Cholas and put an end to Cholas dynastry.
